How to run the IFU code:

Example:
./fold_switch_cooperativity_pdb.py 2OUGC.comp DSSP_072617.pik.xz

Outputs a .comp file in your directory of choice (please open fold_switch_cooperativity_pdb.py to change input and output directories, and update preprocessor directive with the location of your installed python2.7).

*When running the code, make sure that 2oug.pdb is in the pdbPath directory you enter in your version of fold_switch_cooperativity_pdb.py

*NOTE: All .comp filenames should be in the format XXXXY.comp, where XXXX is the uppercase 4-digit PDB code of a file and Y is the chain name.  If not chain name, _ can be used.  Additionally, corresponding .pdb files should be saved in pdbPath with the format xxxx.pdb, where xxxx is the lowercase 4-digit PDB identifier of your protein of interest.

Necessary packages and files:

*Python2.7
*numpy
*Biopython
*LINUS (downloadable from Github) #Molecular calculation code from the Roselab 
*BIOMOL (downloadable from Github) #Code for reading and writing PDBs 
*frag_mvalu.py #Critical for m-value calculations
*verify_log3s_coop.py #Critical for m-value calculations
*coil_lib_v3.py #Critical for m-value calculations
*DSSP_072617.pik.xz (first decompress with xz; this file is a zipped 		                version of all sequences and DSSP secondary                
                      structure annotations from the PDB as of 
                      7/26/17; used by code to align sequences)


Useful packages and files:
*parse_sequence_and_ss.py (useful for making your own pik libraries).  Input file format:
>PDB AA Sequence info
PDB SEQUENCE, 50 characters to a line
>PDB Secondary Structure Info
PDB SECONDARY STRUCTURE ANNOTATIONS, 50 characters to a line
>PDB AA Sequence info2
PDB SEQUENCE, 50 characters to a line
>PDB Secondary Structure Info2
PDB SECONDARY STRUCTURE ANNOTATIONS, 50 characters to a line
É
*compare_ss.py (makes .comp files for IFU code by comparing a secondary structure annotations of a given PDB from a given secondary structure server [we used SPIDER2] with secondary structure annotations of the same PDB from DSSP [using decompressed DSSP_072617.pik.xz])

Annotations from SS Pred Server should be as follows:
>PDB AA Sequence info
PDB SEQUENCE, 50 characters to a line
>PDB Secondary Structure Info
PDB SECONDARY STRUCTURE ANNOTATIONS, 50 characters to a line
*To find your own secondary structure discrepancies, we recommend downloading a secondary structure prediction server that can be installed locally.  SPIDER2 can be found here:
