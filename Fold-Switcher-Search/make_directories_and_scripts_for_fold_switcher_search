1. Divide up the directories:
PDBSEARCHER_DivideUpDirectories -in ss.seqs -size 1000
This made 298 directories out of the 297,968 PDB domains. It also makes a file called “PDBlist.txt” with all the domains in it.
2. Create mega-script that has all the individual calls to find fold-switchers:
PDBSEARCHER_MakeFindSwitcherScriptDirectories -in PDBlist.txt –size 1000 -out bigscript.com
3. Divide up bigscript.com:
PDBSEARCHER_DivideUpFindSwitcherScript -in bigscript.com -size 1000
This made 298 scripts out of the 297,968 PDB domains.
4. Make a qsub script:
PDBSEARCHER_MakeQsubScript –size 298
5. Execute the qsub script (after chmod u+x):
./qsubscript.com

-muts (number of mutations)
